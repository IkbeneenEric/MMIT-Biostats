## Tutorial description

When your dataset is represented as a table or a database, it's difficult to observe much about it beyond its size and the types of variables it contains. 
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use graphical and numerical techniques to begin uncovering the structure of your data. Which variables suggest interesting relationships? Which observations are unusual? 
By the end of the tutorial, you'll be able to answer these questions and more, while generating graphics that are both insightful and beautiful.

## Learning objectives

* Visualize categorical and numerical data using appropriate graphics.
* Create graphical representations of multiple variables.
* Describe the structure revealed by graphics in the language of distributions.
* Use statistics to summarize important aspects of data.
* Identify unusual observations


## Lessons



### 1 - [Transforming data](`r glue("{shiny_url}05-transform")`){target="_blank"}

In this tutorial you will practice  transforming data with R:

* tibbles and `View()`, which let you inspect raw data
* `select()` and `filter()`, which let you extract rows and columns from a data frame
* `arrange()`, which lets you reorder the rows in your data
* `%>%` or `|>`, which organizes your code into reader-friendly "pipes"
* `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `summarize()`, which help you use your data to compute new variables and summary statistics


### 2 - [Visualizing categorical data](`r glue("{shiny_url}02-01-lesson/")`){target="_blank"}

Creating graphical and numerical summaries of two categorical variables, primarily using two R packages: ggplot2 and dplyr.

* Graphical representation of two categorical variables
  * Side-by-side bar charts
  * Stacked bar charts
  * To normalize or not to normalize
* Tabular representation of two categorical variables
  * Computation of margins
  * Counts vs proportions
* Graphical representation of one categorical variable
  * Marginal vs conditional
  * Bar chart
    * ordering
    * data integrity check for levels
  * Pie chart

### 3 - [Visualizing numerical data](`r glue("{shiny_url}02-02-lesson")`){target="_blank"}

Learn useful statistics for describing distributions of data.

* Graphical representation of one categorical and one numerical variable
* Side-by-side boxplots
* Faceted histograms
* Colored density curves
* Graphical representation of one numerical variable
* Marginal vs conditioning
* Histogram
* binwidth
* Density plot
* bandwidth
* Boxplot
* outlier detection

### 4 - [Summarizing with statistics](`r glue("{shiny_url}02-03-lesson-v01")`){target="_blank"}

Statistics for describing distributions of data.

* Center: mean, median, mode
* Shape: skewness, modality
* Spread: range, IQR, SD, variance
* Unusual observations
* Transformations: Logarithm and sqrt to reduce skew in graphics and ease comparisons.
