These tutorials provide a bird's eye view of R visualization and programming you will need to run basic data science and biostatistical tasks. 


## Tutorials

### 1 - [Basic visualization](`r glue("{shiny_url}01-basics-viz/")`){target="_blank"}

Visualization is one of the most important tools for data science and a rewarding way to start learning R; since you get an immediate visual response which helps you explore the data in a variety of ways. In this tutorial you will learn how to...  

*   How to create graphs with a reusable **template**
*   How to add variables to a graph with **aesthetics**
*   How to make different "types" of graphs with **geoms** 

### 2 - [Basic programming](`r glue("{shiny_url}02-basics-prog")`){target="_blank"}


In this tutorial you will acquire the foundations to understand R code. You'll learn about:

* **functions** and their **arguments**
* **objects**
* R's basic **data types**, data structures including **vectors** and **lists** and **package system**

These tutorials are built off the code developed by Garrett Grolemund (co-author of R for [Data Science](R for Data Science)) created the RStudio Primersâ€”a set of free interactive {learnr} apps to teach R to the public. These were hosted on a Shiny server maintained by RStudio and accessible through RStudio.cloud.
