## Read and Visualize

In this milestone, you'll use ggplot2 to visualize the distribution of male and female birth. But before you begin, you'll need to import the `arbuthnot` data set. Unlike Milestone 1, the data set has not been loaded for you.


## Recreation

### Part 1 - Import

In the code chunk below, use a command from the readr package to read in the data set.

* You first need to load the relevant package using the `library(___)` function.
* The data set lives in the file `arbuthnot.csv`, which is stored in the `data/` folder in your working directory.
* Save the data set as an object named `arbuthnot`.


```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

# Load your packages here
# REPLACE
library(tidyverse) 

# Load the dataset from the file
# REPLACE
here <- function(...) {
  args <- list(...)
  here::here("labs", "shared", args)
}
arbuthnot <- read_csv(here("data", "arbuthnot.csv"))  


```

### Part 2 - Pivot longer

Before we can visualize the distribution of births, we first need to transform the dataset. So instead of having...

year | boys | girls
-----|------|-------
1629 | 5218 | 4683
1630 | 4858 | 4457 
1631 | 4422 | 4102 
...  | ...  |  ...


We want to have something that looks like this: 

year | sex   | births
-----|-------|-------
1629 | boys  | 4683
1629 | girls | 4683
1630 | boys  | 4457 
1630 | girls | 4102 
...  |  ...  |  ...


In the second table, every year appears twice: once for the boys and once for the girls. The second table is therefore known as having a `longer` format. To create the longer format, we use two columns (`boys` and `girls`) and transformed them into the following columns: 

* One column with the sex names. We call this column the `name` column, because it consists of the **columnames** from the previous table. 
* A second column with the number of births. We call this column the `value` column, because it contains the **observed values** from the previous table. 

To transform a table to a longer format, we will use the `pivot_longer()` command and store the result in an object that we shall call: `arbuthnot_longer`. The `pivot_longer()` function needs three  


```{r}
#| label: pivot longer

arbuthnot_longer <- arbuthnot |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = boys:girls, 
    names_to  = "_____", 
    values_to = "_____"
    )


# REPLACE
arbuthnot_longer <- arbuthnot |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = boys:girls, 
    names_to = "sex", 
    values_to = "births"
    )



```



### Part 3 - Visualize

In this section you will try to recreate two plots. 

-   Plot A: shows the births of boys and females over time. 
-   Plot BL shows a boxplot comparing the distribution of the births of boys and girls. 

Run the code chunk below to see the two plots. Your task is to recreate these plots. 


```{r}
#| label: recreate this

# Plot a: the births of boys and girls over time
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("labs/shared/images/milestone02_a.png"))

# Plot b: distribution of births of boys and girls
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("labs/shared/images/milestone02_b.png"))


```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above. Before plotting, remember to use the data in its `longer` format. What happens if you use the data in its `wider` format?


```{r}
#| label: recreation-visualize


# REPLACE
arbuthnot_longer |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = births, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 10000, 1000)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1630, 1710, 10)) +
  labs(title = "Male and female christenings (births)", subtitle = "London, 1629-1710.") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
# ggsave(here::here("labs/shared/images/milestone02_a.png"))


arbuthnot_longer |>
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = births)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 10000, 1000)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of births", subtitle = "Arbuthnot dataset, London 1629-1710.") +  
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# ggsave(here::here("labs/shared/images/milestone02_b.png"))

```

## Extension 

Using the code chunk below, investigate a research question about this data, using the visualization skills you learned this week. Some ideas:

1. Try to compare the two distributions in other ways: for example, you can experiment with `geom_violin` or with [`geom_density_ridges`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html). 
2. You may want to use statistical tests to compare the two distributions. Search the web on how to run a `t-test` in R and try running both independent and dependent t-tests. What did you find? 
3. Try running the nonparametric version of the independent-samples t-test (Mann-Whitney U-Test) and the nonparametric version of the paired-samples t-test (the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test).
4. Do the same using `ggstatsplot`, an extension of `ggplot2` package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.  You can find examples here https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/



```{r}
#| label: extension
library(ggstatsplot)

t.test(arbuthnot$boys, arbuthnot$girls)
t.test(arbuthnot$boys, arbuthnot$girls, paired = TRUE)

p1 <- ggbetweenstats(
  arbuthnot_longer, 
  x = sex, 
  y = births, 
  type = "parametric", 
  bf.message = FALSE
)  + theme(text = element_text(size = 14))


# arbuthnot_longer |> 
#   slice_sample(n = 164) |> 
#   ggwithinstats( 
#   x = sex, 
#   y = births, 
#   type = "parametric", 
#   bf.message = FALSE
# ) + theme(text = element_text(size = 14))


library(patchwork)
p1 / p2
ggsave(here::here("labs", "shared", "images", "between-within.png"))

arbuthnot_longer |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, births, color = sex)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  # theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", text = element_text(size = 14)) + 
  labs(title = "The Arbuthnot birth count")

# ggsave(here::here("labs", "shared", "images", "arbuthnot.png"))


```

###. The `present` dataset

You can find the `present` dataset in the `data` folder. It consists of an updated version of the historical Arbuthnot dataset. Numbers of boys and girls born in the United States between 1940 and 2002. 

1. See if you can replicate the same visualisation using the `present.csv`. Do you see any difference 
2. Since the number of births in this dataset are way greater, we cannot just combine the data, we can, however, 

```{r}

present <- read_csv(here::here("labs/shared/data/present.csv")) |> 
  mutate(prop = boys / (boys + girls))

arbuthnot <- arbuthnot |> mutate(prop = boys / (boys + girls))

df <- arbuthnot |> bind_rows(present) |> 
  mutate(source = ifelse(year < 1800, "arbuthnot", "present"))

df |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, prop)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~source, scale = "free")

df |> group_by(source) |> 
  summarise(mn.prop = mean(prop), sd.prop = sd(prop))

```
