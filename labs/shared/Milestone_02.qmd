## Read and Visualize

In this milestone, you'll use ggplot2 to visualize the distribution of male and female birth. But before you begin, you'll need to import the `arbuthnot` data set. Unlike Milestone 1, the data set has not been loaded for you.


## Recreation

### Part 1 - Import

In the code chunk below, use a command from the readr package to read in the data set.

* You first need to load the relevant package using the `library(___)` function.
* The data set lives in the file `arbuthnot.csv`, which is stored in the `data/` folder in your working directory.
* Save the data set as an object named `arbuthnot`.


```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

# Load your packages here


# Load the dataset from the file


```

### Part 2 - Pivot longer

Before we can visualize the distribution of births, we first need to transform the dataset. So instead of having...

year | boys | girls
-----|------|-------
1629 | 5218 | 4683
1630 | 4858 | 4457 
1631 | 4422 | 4102 
...  | ...  |  ...


We want to have something that looks like this: 

year | sex   | births
-----|-------|-------
1629 | boys  | 4683
1629 | girls | 4683
1630 | boys  | 4457 
1630 | girls | 4102 
...  |  ...  |  ...


In the second table, every year appears twice: once for the boys and once for the girls. The second table is therefore known as having a `longer` format. To create the longer format, we use two columns (`boys` and `girls`) and transformed them into the following columns: 

* One column with the sex names. We call this column the `name` column, because it consists of the **columnames** from the previous table. 
* A second column with the number of births. We call this column the `value` column, because it contains the **observed values** from the previous table. 

To transform a table to a longer format, we will use the `pivot_longer()` command and store the result in an object that we shall call: `arbuthnot_longer`. The `pivot_longer()` function needs three  


```{r}
#| label: pivot longer

arbuthnot_longer <- arbuthnot |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = boys:girls, 
    names_to = "___", 
    values_to = "___"
    )

```



### Part 3 - Visualize

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot.


```{r}
#| label: recreate this
knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone02.png")

```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above. Before plotting, remember to use the data in its `longer` format. What happens if you use the data in its `wider` format?


```{r}
#| label: recreation-visualize


```

## Extension

Using the code chunk below, investigate a research question about this data, using the visualization skills you learned this week. Some ideas:

1. Try to compare the two distributions in other ways: for example, you can experiment with `geom_violin` or with [`geom_density_ridges`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html). 
2. See if you can replicate the same visualisation using the `present.csv`. Does the 
3. You may want to use statistical tests to compare the two distributions. Search the web on how to run a `t-test` in R and try running both independent and dependent t-tests. What did you find? 
4. Try running the nonparametric version of the independent-samples t-test (Mann-Whitney U-Test) and the nonparametric version of the paired-samples t-test (the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test).
5. Do the same using `ggstatsplot`, an extension of `ggplot2` package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.  You can find examples here https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/
